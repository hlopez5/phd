## Residential Roof-top Solar
Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage systems promise to alter the electric grid by decarbonizing and decentralizing energy services. The end users of energy are no longer just consumers of energy but also producers, leading to a new term , "prosumers". DERs are becoming more affordable for the average home owner and products such as Tesla's Powerwall and Solar Roof make it likely that adoption of these technologies will continue to grow.[1] In addition to commercial adoption, political policies are now in place to push adoption of these technologies to aid in reduction of dependencies on fossil fuels.
