## History of Electricity Markets
The electric utility industry was first founded in 1879, and has been subject to many municipal, state and federal regulation since then. The electric utilities are considered "natural monopolies" because the efficiency in production would be higher when a single firm supplies the entire market [1]. In 1935 the United States congress passed a law to regulate the electric utilities at the state level. The Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) [2] enforced state regulation making the utility companies incorporate in the same state they were operating in. They also owned the monopoly of that market and were forced to set prices based on the "fair rate of return" [3]. Then, from 1940s to the 1960s, the electric industry grew rapidly because of demand in energy usage. The increase in usage created environmental concerns as well as concerns over dependency on foreign oil. The need for regulation to limit emissions and to reduce oil usage led to the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) [4]. The law was designed to promote the adoption of renewable resources and efficient generation [2]. 

The most interesting component of the incoming regulation, was that it also forced utilities to buy power from independent companies that could produce power for less than what it would have cost the utility to generate the power, called "avoided cost", promoting competition into the power generation business [5]. A new class of exempt wholesale generators prompted the expansion of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate open transmission access. The independent generators could now dive deeper into renewable generation across the country. By the 1990s the most prominent initiative was in the California Power Exchange (PX), a regional spot market for buyers and sellers to trade electricity. [6] The California ISO was started in 1990 and was designed to operate the state’s power transmission grid and provide open access to all qualified users [7]. Even with competition in the market the PX prices remained high because of collusion by power producers and power brokers. Order 888 by FERC was passed to introduce competition at a wholesale level, but the market had fluctuating prices and resulted in an energy crisis [8]. Manipulation of the market by nefarious companies such as Enron, led to stricter regulation around how the market should operate. The requirements for the market to be more flexible and capable of integrating renewables is also an inevitable challenge [9].

## The Smart Grid
“The grid” refers to the electric grid that consists of a network of transmission lines, substations, transformers, etc. which transfer the electricity from the power plant to the home or business [10]. The average age of power plants in north America is 35 years old. Also, more than half of the electricity in north America is generated through coal and the delivery efficiency of electricity is an abysmal 35%. Finally, frequent and major blackouts in the past indicate critical vulnerabilities in the electrical infrastructure [11].The challenges of creating a more efficient grid led to the adoption of smart management systems that can intelligently integrate the actions of all users connected to it, including generators, consumers and those that do both in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. The result is a "Smart grid", an advanced power system that integrates the electrical network with smart digital communication technology. Providing bi-directional communication between the utility and consumers, leveraging smart sensors across the system [11].

Conventional electric power systems in most countries have been designed so that a central power station produces electrical power. Then transformers increase the voltage to high levels which are suitable for transmission. Once the energy arrives at a community the voltage is gradually stepped down to lower levels into the distribution network until it is finally dropped into the consumer’s premise. The energy is then measured by a meter that keeps record of the energy consumption in real-time [12]. The flow of electricity was traditionally uni-directional but in the age of distributed generation the grid must also deal with bi-directional flow back to the grid from producers who used to just be customers.

The Smart Grid must grow to incorporate the bi-directional flow of electricity between supply and demand sources as penetration of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) like Photo-voltaic Solar Panels, (PV) increases in residential sectors. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) [13] was designed to address the smart grid transition improving in the following areas :

- Reliability – the reliability of grid will be improved by several factors including less disturbances and blackouts.
- Economics – by reducing the electricity rates and creating new jobs and enhancing the U.S. gross domestic product
- Efficiency – by reducing the costs associated with generation, transmission and distribution of the electricity
- Environmental – by reducing the number of emissions by increasing the integration of renewable resources.
- Security – by reducing the probability of manmade attacks and natural disasters.
- Safety – by reducing the consequences of any grid-related events

The reliability, economics and efficiency of the grid will improve as communication technologies transition into advanced implementations of hardened sensor networks across the grid known as the industrial internet of things (IIoT) [14]. The IIoT improvements to the grid can affect the energy generation efficiency, demand side management and even the transmission and distribution of energy for energy carriers. The more data the grid provides in real-time allows for optimization leading to greater reliability and efficiency, reducing the cost of electricity [15].

The environmental, safety, and security aspects of the grid will improve as the adoption of distributed generation and energy storage improves. DG systems are typically renewable as roof-top solar (PV) . The environmental benefits of renewables in the short term are attractive but there is still an environmental cost to create PV technology. The distribution of generation and adoption of microgrids could decentralize the security risk of the current grid improving its overall-reliability and increasing resiliency. The overall challenges of the smart grid are many, but driving technological trends seem to point to a redesign of the infrastructure and the market structure that operates it. The increase of DG and renewables with the increase of retail electric prices and the decreasing of profitable incentive tariff rates are all challenges for the grid. [16]

## Residential Roof-top Solar
In recent years, there has been an urgent pursuit of an alternative energy system in which energy production, transmission, distribution, and consumption can take place in an environmentally sustainable fashion. As a result, the development of smart, sustainable, and green solutions is becoming more significant, including the widespread deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) at residences [17], the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs), and the establishment of various smart energy services, e.g., demand response management, for the effective management of energy resources within the electricity grid. DERs such as rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems and energy storage systems promise to alter the electric grid by decarbonizing and decentralizing energy services. The end users of energy are no longer just consumers of energy but also producers, leading to a new term , "prosumers". DERs are becoming more affordable for the average home owner and products such as Tesla's Powerwall and Solar Roof make it likely that adoption of these technologies will continue to grow.[18] In addition to commercial adoption, political policies are now in place to push adoption of these technologies to aid in reduction of dependencies on fossil fuels.

## Cooperative Game Theory

Auction games have been proposed for trading both storage space and renewable energy from DERs [Custom Papers/References > Energy storage sharing in smart grid A modified auction-based approach](app://obsidian.md/Custom%20Papers/References#Energy%20storage%20sharing%20in%20smart%20grid%20A%20modified%20auction-based%20approach). The real-time implementation of a multiagent-based game-theoretic reverse auction model for microgrid market operations featuring conventional and renewable DERs is discussed. [Custom Papers/References > Real-time implementation of multiagent-based game theory reverse auction model for microgrid market operation](app://obsidian.md/Custom%20Papers/References#Real-time%20implementation%20of%20multiagent-based%20game%20theory%20reverse%20auction%20model%20for%20microgrid%20market%20operation) The proposed methodology was realistically implemented in a smart grid system at Florida International University, and the subsequent investigation shows that the proposed algorithm and the industrial hardware-based infrastructure are suitable for implementation in the existing electric utility grid.

Meanwhile, the authors in [Custom Papers/References > Energy storage sharing in smart grid A modified auction-based approach](app://obsidian.md/Custom%20Papers/References#Energy%20storage%20sharing%20in%20smart%20grid%20A%20modified%20auction-based%20approach) utilize an auction game to study the solution of joint-energy-storage ownership sharing between multiple shared facility controllers (SFCs) and those dwelling in a residential community. The auction process possesses both incentive-compatibility and individual-rationality properties and is also capable of enabling the residential units (RUs) to decide the fraction of their shared energy storage capacity with the SFCs of the community to assist in storing electricity

For example, in [Custom Papers/References > Direct electricity trading in smart grid A coalitional game analysis](app://obsidian.md/Custom%20Papers/References#Direct%20electricity%20trading%20in%20smart%20grid%20A%20coalitional%20game%20analysis) a coalitional game is used to study the cooperation between small-scale DERs and energy users to enable the direct trading of energy without going through retailers. The asymptotic Shapley value is the core of the coalitional game so that no small-scale DERs or energy users have an incentive to abandon the coalition, which suggests the stable direct trading of energy for the proposed pricing scheme. Furthermore, numerous case studies demonstrate that the scheme is suitable for practical implementation. The authors in [Custom Papers/References > Economic power transaction using coalitional game strategy in micro-grids](app://obsidian.md/Custom%20Papers/References#Economic%20power%20transaction%20using%20coalitional%20game%20strategy%20in%20micro-grids) focus on comprehensive economic power transactions of multiple microgrid networks with multiple agents; they design a three-stage algorithm based on a coalitional game strategy and include request, exchange, merge-and-split, and cooperative transaction stages. The developed algorithm enables microgrids to form coalitions where each microgrid can exchange power directly by paying a transmission fee.
